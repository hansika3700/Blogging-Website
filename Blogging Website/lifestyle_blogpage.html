                                <a href="#"> Why are dogs an important part of human life? </a>
                                <p> Companionship. Dogs provide companionship and company.
                                    They can be a comfort to people who crave unconditional
                                    interaction with another living being. According to Vanderbilt University,
                                    dogs can decrease levels of human loneliness and give humans a sense
                                    of purpose as they care for their animal companions.
                                    <br>
                                    This can be especially beneficial for people who live alone, don't socialize much,
                                    are
                                    empty-nesters or recently experienced a major change of life, such as the loss of a
                                    close human companion to death or divorce.
                                    <br>
                                    Dogs can help reduce stress levels in human beings and are often used for
                                    therapeutic
                                    purposes in hospitals, nursing homes and hospices. Playing with a dog, exercising,
                                    walking or running can help human beings reduce stress levels and increase their
                                    health
                                    and well-being. Studies by Harvard University and Kansas State show dog interaction
                                    with
                                    humans can help combat challenges associated with some form of heart disease and
                                    autism.
                                    <br>
                                    Dogs provide a sense of security for human companions. Trained watchdogs can provide
                                    a
                                    high degree of security, while even small house dogs can offer a sense of protection
                                    by
                                    alerting their owners to approaching strangers or unusual circumstances in the home.
                                    Dogs employed by government agencies and police organizations sniff out contraband
                                    in
                                    places likes airports and large public venues to ensure public security. According
                                    to a
                                    Texas A&M website, dogs utilized specifically for security purposes require a
                                    specialized degree of training to be safe and effective for their handlers.
                                    <br>
                                    Many families use the family dog to help teach responsibility to children. According
                                    to
                                    Karen Stephens of Eastern Florida University's Parenting Exchange, kids can be
                                    taught
                                    valuable traits and life skills through positive interaction with the family pet and
                                    by
                                    taking responsibility for feeding, walking, training and grooming. Children can
                                    learn
                                    the value of treating all living things with respect and dignity when they have the
                                    opportunity care for and love a family dog.

                                    <br>
                                    Trees are the most beautiful and useful gifts of nature. They are a wonderful
                                    creation
                                    of God, priceless and matchless in their qualities and uses. It is for trees that
                                    the
                                    Earth of our looks so beautiful and is so suitable for our sustenance. It is for
                                    them
                                    that we live. Had their not been trees on Earth there would be not have any question
                                    of
                                    survival of the living organism on earth. They are our life's blood our life's soul.
                                    Trees square measure the most important and longest living organisms on earth. To
                                    grow
                                    tall, the trees display miraculous feats of engineering and a complex chemical
                                    factory.
                                    It has the ability to absorb water and salt from the earth and transport them up to

                                    produce
                                    the nutrients which serve as food for them. In this method they produce wood
                                    likewise as
                                    several chemicals, seeds and fruit of great utility to man.

                                    Trees are our great friends. They are a part and parcel of earthly life. All life
                                    directly or indirectly owes its existence to them. Trees bring clouds and cause
                                    rainfall. They absorb carbon dioxide, the harmful gas caused by us but they release
                                    oxygen which we need for our life. Trees offer us cool shade during summer and keep
                                    our

                                    natural habitat of many animals, birds and insects. Trees make the land fertile for
                                    cultivation of all kinds of agriculture. Trees and plants are the sources of a lot
                                    of
                                    life saving drugs. They protect us from inclement wind also.

                                    Trees prevent soil erosion and thereby saves our Land for our uses. They guard
                                    against
                                    pollution, warming and heavy rains. They are important for keeping the air clean and
                                    healthy for U.S.. They prevent flooding. Trees from a natural barrier against the
                                    wind
                                    forest help to stop wind sweeping through the neighborhood, gaining speed and

                                    <br>
                                    Trees improve air quality by acting as natural air filters exclude dirt, smoke and
                                    fumes
                                    from the atmosphere by trappings them on their leaves, branches and trunks. Trees

                                    back the atmospheric phenomenon by removing greenhouse emission from the air and
                                    cathartic atomic number 8. Trees in themselves benefit the environment and the
                                    landscape
                                    but they are also an important and integral part of the ecosystem providing benefits
                                    to
                                    wildlife and biodiversity. Thus trees are in great the service of mankind. We are
                                    really
                                    in debited to them for their service and sacrifice.

                                    frail and take many chances. I’m also the target for a lot of people, for emotional
                                    support and other things. My parents depend a lot on me to take care of things when
                                    they
                                    can’t, especially because I'm the only girl.

                                    I recall my 5th grade classroom, the desks were set up in rows of six, and I sat in
                                    the
                                    middle row, of a large room filled with an average sized class. And that’s where he
                                    sat,
                                    right there in front of me; now being a female in a male bias world I found that
                                    most
                                    guys don’t expect you to know how to fight. And that’s where he made his mistake.
                                    His
                                    name was Tommy and he tried to take my pencil, this might not seem like a big deal
                                    now
                                    but ever since I was younger, I had an “obsessive compulsive disorder” type of
                                    thing; I
                                    absolutely positively could not stand to have people touching my things, or things
                                    that
                                    I had previously touched. So I asked him kindly to please not touch my things…he
                                    didn’t
                                    quite listen. He continued to grab for my book bag when I told him again “DO NOT
                                    TOUCH
                                    MY THINGS” I was getting madder and he didn’t seem to comprehend the level of
                                    seriousness displayed in my threatening tone. “Shut up” he snapped back at me “don’t
                                    be
                                    a tattle tale”. “I wont,” I said through my teeth “but stop touching my things” with
                                    an
                                    angry shove, he pushed me. In rebuttal, I shoved him back.
                                    <br>

                                    Ever since I was younger, this problem frustrated me, the problem of male bias that
                                    seemed so prominent in the world and especially in my life. Just because I’m a dress
                                    wearing, pony tailed, doll playing human doesn’t mean I’m not as tough as anyone
                                    else in
                                    this world. I believe that since girls have a different in sight look of things,
                                    people
                                    think we’re weak, and powerless.

                                    Fathers always expect their sons to be the tough ones, while the girls are supposed
                                    to
                                    be the sensitive ones, the ones who cry when they fall not the boys. Mothers always
                                    teach their daughters to clean and cook before they grow older. Girls are taught to
                                    be
                                    mothers of animals-09 and baby dolls while boys are being taught to be Harley riders
                                    and
                                    wrestlers. Girls are taught that in a dress you’re a princess and no one could
                                    change
                                    that. Boys are taught that the more muscles you have the more people like you.

                                    Girls walking around in short skirts, short shorts and tight clothes just to get the
                                    attention of another person. To me people aren’t important id much rather go outside
                                    feeling comfortable then to go out wondering “does this shirt look right?” or “is
                                    this
                                    the right fit?”. I clearly don’t care what people think of me, people have their own
                                    opinions and thoughts of what a girl is supposedly supposed to say, wear and look.

                                <a href="#"> Marriage - A long lasting relationship!?</a>
                                <p>
                                    In general, marriage can be described as a bond/commitment between a man and a
                                    woman.
                                    Also, this bond is strongly connected with love, tolerance, support, and harmony.
                                    Also,
                                    creating a family means to enter a new stage of social advancement. Marriages help
                                    in
                                    founding the new relationship between females and males. Also, this is thought to be
                                    the
                                    highest as well as the most important Institution in our society. The marriage essay
                                    is
                                    a guide to what constitutes a marriage in India.
                                    <br>
                                    Whenever we think about marriage, the first thing that comes to our mind is the
                                    long-lasting relationship. Also, for everyone, marriage is one of the most important
                                    decisions in their life. Because you are choosing to live your whole life with that
                                    1
                                    person. Thus, when people decide to get married, they think of having a lovely
                                    family,
                                    dedicating their life together, and raising their children together. The circle of
                                    humankind is like that only.
                                    <br>
                                    As it is seen with other experiences as well, the experience of marriage can be
                                    successful or unsuccessful. If truth to be held, there is no secret to a successful
                                    marriage. It is all about finding the person and enjoying all the differences and
                                    imperfections, thereby making your life smooth. So, a good marriage is something
                                    that is
                                    supposed to be created by two loving people. Thus, it does not happen from time to
                                    time.
                                    Researchers believe that married people are less depressed and more happy as
                                    compared to
                                    unmarried people.

                            <p>
                                Industrialisation has historically led to urbanization by creating economic growth and
                                job opportunities that draw people to cities. Urbanization typically begins when a
                                factory or multiple factories are established within a region, thus creating a high
                                demand for factory labor. Other businesses such as building manufacturers, retailers,
                                and service providers then follow the factories to meet the product demands of the
                                workers. This creates even more jobs and demands for housing, thus establishing an urban
                                area.
                                <br>

                                In the modern era, manufacturing facilities like factories are often replaced by
                                technology-industry hubs. These technological hubs draw workers from other areas in the
                                same way factories used to, contributing to urbanization.
                                <br>
                                <b> Urbanization Continues After Industrialization Occurs</b>
                                As industrialization creates economic growth, the demand for improved education and
                                public works agencies that are characteristic of urban areas increases. This demand
                                occurs because businesses looking for new technology to increase productivity require an
                                educated workforce, and pleasant living conditions attract skilled workers to the area.
                                <br>

                                Once an area is industrialized, the process of urbanization continues for a much longer
                                period of time as the area goes through several phases of economic and social reform.
                                This concept is best illustrated by comparing a city such as Bangkok, located in a
                                lesser-developed country, with an American city such as Los Angeles and a European city
                                such as Berlin. Each city has a progressively higher level of social, environmental and
                                economic prosperity achieved through increased education, government intervention, and
                                social reform.
