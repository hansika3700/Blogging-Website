                                <br>
                                <p>We all love foods in restaurants, cafes and bakeries, but what if I tell you,
                                    you can make the same food at home tastier and healthier. Making muffins and
                                    cakes out of whole wheat flour and for gluten intolerants with almond flour,
                                    so that you don't miss out on the feeling of enjoying your favourite foods,
                                    compromising
                                    with your health. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Using what is available at home during the quaratine times have made us realise that
                                    there's nothing
                                    better than homemade food. We tries each amd every thing we could at home during
                                    lockdown, with whatever
                                    material was available and everything came out good. We tries sweets, continental
                                    food,
                                    cakes, Whole Wheat muffins,
                                    Wheat cakes etc. We even tried Ghewar that seemed impossible to cook but still it
                                    came
                                    out just fine enough to perform rituals
                                    on holy festivals. We even made Jalebis and what not. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Everyone in our family and friends encouraged us so much for our food that me and my
                                    sister started am Instagram handle
                                    named Creative Food Maniacs. We chose this name to the profile beacuse we not only
                                    upload homemade food but and we are crazy about it,
                                    but also upload and share our some of the art pieces and drawing that we made during
                                    this lockdown. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Returning back to the main topic, we can conclude that home mde food is the best and
                                    our
                                    motto is and should be
                                    Happiness is Homemade. There's nothing that cannot be made at home using the simple
                                    ingredients used in our kitchen by our moms.
                                    We went so swift in making tasty and delicious food like sprinfg rolls, momos,
                                    sandwiches etc at home that not a single day went
                                    by when we did't cook anything in the evening. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Now the food we coook is so famous among our family and friends that there are
                                    special
                                    gatherings and get togethers just for earing our

                                <a href="#"> A coffee a day, keeps a Grumpy away! </a>
                                <br>
                                <p> I believe in enjoying a cup of coffee. Stepping into the coffee shop and taking in a
                                    breath of
                                    fresh coffee stimulates my sense of smell to explore every scent around me. When I
                                    finally grasp
                                    my cup, I feel the coffee raise my heart rate making every pump of blood loud and
                                    clear.
                                    Even the
                                    bitter tasting cups, make my day brighter. Coffee never fails to stimulate my sense
                                    of
                                    smell, touch,
                                    and taste.
                                    <br>

                                    That slight moment of smelling the ground coffee beans awakens my sense of smell.
                                    The
                                    scent of coffee
                                    is almost bitter but the distinctive smell arouses my nose to explore every scent
                                    around
                                    me. I suddenly
                                    interpret a sweet aroma and observe the red rose decorating the small brown coffee
                                    table
                                    where I sit.
                                    The flower’s sweet smell makes me realize how much beauty this one flower’s scent
                                    adds
                                    to ambience of
                                    the small coffee shop. If flowers did not exist, the world would bare less
                                    character.
                                    Each and every cup
                                    of coffee I drink allows me to more fully enjoy even the smallest of scents flowers
                                    bless the world with
                                    every day. <br>
                                    <br>
                                    Caffeine can affect your sleep by keeping you awake longer, thereby shortening the
                                    amount of sleep you get,
                                    and giving you less time in the restorative stages of sleep. This takes a toll on
                                    your
                                    level of alertness
                                    the next day and on overall health.
                                    <br>
                                    Interestingly, though, caffeine doesn’t affect the stages of sleep the way other
                                    stimulants do, so it’s a
                                    better choice than speed or other uppers if you need to stay awake.
                                    <br>
                                    There are many health benefits that come from drinking coffee. Coffee can overall
                                    make
                                    you a happier person.
                                    Drinking coffee can make a positive impact on your life. Does coffee really stunt
                                    your
                                    Growth? How does
                                    drinking coffee help in your day to day life? Coffee is loaded with antioxidants and
                                    beneficial nutrients that
                                    can improve your health. Studies show that coffee drinkers have a much lower risk of
                                    several serious diseases.
                                    Coffee can make you feel happier and reduce the rate of suicide. A study carried out
                                    by
                                    the National Institute
                                    of Health Study in the US found that those who drink four or more cups of coffee
                                    were
                                    about ten percent less
                                    likely to be depressed than people who never drink it. <br>
