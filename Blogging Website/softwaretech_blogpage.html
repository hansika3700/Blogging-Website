                            <a href="#"> LATEST TECHNOLOGY TRENDS </a>
                            <br>
                            <p> The software is now so rapidly evolving that quarterly trend forecasts seem so redundant 
                                before they even go on life as a blog post or article. As technology evolves, 
                                it can be created and enhanced quickly, and rates are that before they eventually 
                                become <br>
<br>
                                1. Artificial Intelligence: <br>
                                Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been strongly influenced in 
                                recent years but is still a trend to be seen as the effect of Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
                                on the way we live, work and play are only at an early stage. Certain types of AI have been 
                                developed to which we will refer, including machine learning. AI refers to computer systems 
                                programmed to mimic the understanding of people and execute tasks such as pictures, speech, 
                                patterns, and decision-making. Such tasks can be done faster and more accurately than people <br>
<br>
                                2. Machine learning: <br>
                                The AI group is machine learning. Computers are programmed to recognize something that is not 
                                meant to be achieved through machine learning: by patterns and observations into data. 
                                Therefore, two types of knowledge were tracked and unattended. <br>
                                While machine learning is a subset of the AI, machine learning sub-sets include neural networks, 
                                NLP and profound training are also available. That sub-set offers an opportunity to specialize in 
                                a slowly developing sector. <br>
<br>
                                3. Automation or RPA Robot Method: <br>
                                The Automation or RPA Robot software, like AI and machine learning, is the automation or 
                                RPA of the automated process that automates staff. RPA is using corporate operations 
                                streamlined tools, such as system evaluation, storage of payments, data management and 
                                even e-mail replies. RPA automates replicated work performed by humans automatically. 
                                These are not just menial activities for low-paid workers: up to 45% of our occupations 
                                can be remotely handled, like financial management, physicians, and CEOs. <br>
<br>
                                4. Wireless Computing: <br>
                                Cloud computing is historically a technological trend and is operated by major players such 
                                as AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud (Amazon Web Services). As companies move ever further 
                                towards a cloud solution, the rise in cloud computing grows. Still, though, this is not the new 
                                technology. <br>
<br>
                                5. Virtual reality: <br>
                                Virtual reality plunges the consumer into an area while it improves the atmosphere. 
                                Although VR is mainly used in sports, it is also used as a device of modelling, for instance, 
                                Virtual Vessel. <br>
<br>
                                6. BlockChain: <br>
                                In many other ways, most people consider block chain software to be of interest to crypto 
                                currencies, such as Bit coin. The chain block can be described as data that can only be added, 
                                removed or changed as easy as possible. it is the term ' chain,' when you create a series of 
                                data. It is so secure that the prior frames cannot be changed. Also, a group supports block 
                                chains so nobody can manipulate the data. To supervise or verify transactions for the block 
                                chain, you do not need a competent third party. See our Block chain guide for a detailed and 
                                structured review of the program. Various industries include the block chain, and the need for 
                                skilled experts grows with the use of block chain software. <br>
<br>
                                7. Internet of things (IoT): <br>
                                There are now many "materials" developed for Wi-Fi networking that enables it to be linked to 
                                and from the web. The internet of things is the future. Computers, home equipment, cars, and 
                                many more can already be connected to the network. However, experts say that, despite such 
                                advantages in the design and implementation of IoT, not enough IT practitioners are educated 
                                for the IoT work. A survey in IT Pro Today says we need over 200,000 IT workers who are not in 
                                the process stage, and 25.7% recognize that the most significant barrier to growth for the 
                                sector is a skills gap. It makes it easy for anyone involved in an IoT profession to become 
                                motivated by a variety of options. The skills required include IoT protection, cloud computing, 
                                data analysis, automation, embedded system experience, software expertise. After all, the Internet of 
                                Things is very different, meaning that the skills needed are varied. <br>
<br>
                                8. Cyber protection: <br>
                                Cyber security may not sound like new technologies because it has existed for a long time, 
                                but because of the always new threats, some other developments evolve. Malicious hackers who 
                                want to access data remotely won't give up and still discover ways to implement the most 
                                stringent security measures. The implementation of new health-enhancing technologies was partly 
                                responsible for it. So long as we have malwaretechnology trends, we will have cyber security as emerging 
                                technology which is continuously evolving to defend against hackers. <br>
