                                    I live in New Delhi, the capital of our incredible India. I was always fascinated by
                                    different cities where my friends
                                    lived until I knew that my birthplace Delhi is charming in it’s own way. Starting

                                    from India Gate is Rajpath, a road that straight leads to the Rashtrapati Bhawan.
                                    The

                                    Place. It was built by British and it has retained the charm over the years. The
                                    beauty
                                    lies in the way it’s constructed in concentric circles and the mains are the inner
                                    circle and the outer circle. These circles enclose a lush green garden with
                                    blossoming
                                    flowers where our national flag flare with pride. One can find essence of patriotism
                                    in

                                    Masjid. This market has a fantastic fragrance spread across the area and it attracts
                                    the
                                    tourist and the city dwellers to its doorstep. Coming next is the largest wholesale
                                    market of fruits and vegetables, which is again in Delhi. Along with spices market,
                                    Delhi also occupies the largest wholesale market of fruits and vegetables in Asia.
                                    The
                                    Azadpur market is approximately around 80 acres and that is huge. One can never stay
                                    afar from food. Savouring oneself with food especially if its cheap and tasty and
                                    healthy is the best thing one can do with themselves.

                                    <b> Experiences to remember</b> <br>
                                    If someone comes to Delhi and explore, they can create memories and experiences of
                                    lifetime. There can hardly be something that Delhi doesn’t offer. Everything a
                                    person do
                                    in Delhi makes a person want even longer to stay here. Starting off with the fact
                                    that
                                    Delhi is home to the President of India, where India being the world’s largest
                                    democracy
                                    which epitomizes strength, its democratic traditions and secular character. If one
                                    visits Delhi, they can say they have seen the house of the President and the Prime
                                    Minister of the country, isn’t it incredible? Then comes the monumental beauty of
                                    Delhi,
                                    which can never escape from the hearts of the onlookers. The forts filled with
                                    historical essence and the temples along with their devotional beauty slays everyone
                                    with the peace and serenity they offer. Also, there is the Signature bridge across
                                    the
                                    river Yamuna, which is known to be the tallest structure in Delhi and India’s first
                                    asymmetrical cable-stayed bridge, so why would someone not remember it? <br>
                                    Then there are markets providing anything one could possibly ask for, at best
                                    prices.
                                    Food at every crossroads. A person in Delhi can say that they are in the leading
                                    commercial center of India. We have talked about the places on can visit but what
                                    about
                                    the transportation facilities in Delhi. Well, they are one to be talked about. Delhi
                                    has
                                    the 13th largest metro rail network in the world. It makes almost every part of
                                    Delhi
                                    easily approachable. Whereas the Delhi Transport Corporation along with other
                                    transport
                                    services in Delhi entirely run on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG), making it
                                    substantial
                                    for the local people and for the visitors. Another wonderful experience one could
                                    get in
                                    Delhi is that it is the second most bird-rich capital in the world. The Delhi ridge
                                    inhabits a large number of bird species. This can be witnessed in the one of most
                                    famous
                                    bird sanctuaries of Delhi the Okhla Bird Sanctuary. To relive the charm of the
                                    British
                                    Era one can visit Connought Place. It is one of the most important landmarks of
                                    Delhi.
                                    Going to India Gate and Roaming around the empty roads in Connught Place is total
                                    fun.
                                    Last but not the least the beautiful gardens of Delhi will make you stay in here
                                    forever. Staying in Delhi or visiting Delhi is itself an Experience to Remember.

                                </a>
                                <p> Travelling becomes a hobby and necessity for all age people.
                                    Youth are playing a vital and most important role for the area of travelling.
                                    People who are engaged with the business sector must travel on the regular
                                    basis to promote their business and trade and on other hand youth gives
                                    importance to travelling for the education and leisure. Travelling is now
                                    regarded as an important part of education and activities for youths.
                                    <br>
                                    Educational tours for young students increases their knowledge powers and gives new
                                    thoughts and ideas to grow up in them. It’s a true fact that the education and
                                    knowledge
                                    of man remain incomplete if he or she does not visit important places of the world.
                                    Reading of books only provides man with half knowledge. But travelling with eyes
                                    wide
                                    open and mindfully gives him full knowledge.
                                    <br>

                                    On other ways, travelling is the most important mean of gaining health, happiness, a
                                    pleasure. It also helps to develop national unity in youth. Travelling is mostly for
                                    pleasure as it exhilarates out the heart and broadens our mind. We find great
                                    pleasure
                                    in seeing the beauties of nature. The mighty mountains and the meadows, the streams
                                    and
                                    the river, the deep blue sky, the green trees, the grand desert and the vast sea all
                                    touch the heart of the traveller.

                                    Travel also develops the youth and providing an opportunity to meet new people .
                                    Travelling makes us familiar with the vast world outside the narrow space of our
                                    homes.
                                    We meet many people belonging to various cultures. We start appreciating the
                                    tradition,
                                    manners and customs of other people. We often accept and introduce some of their
                                    good
                                    elements in our own culture.
